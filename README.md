Saber Breaker
This is a single-file, responsive brick-breaker style game written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a space/sci-fi theme and Lightsaber mechanics.

It uses the Tone.js library for sound effects and Firebase Firestore for cross-user high-score tracking.

Deployment
Since this is a single-file application (index.html), deployment to GitHub Pages is straightforward:

Create a Repository: Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., saber-breaker).

Add Files: Add this index.html file (and optionally this README.md) to the root of your repository.

Enable GitHub Pages:

Go to your repository's Settings tab.

Navigate to Pages in the left sidebar.

Under "Build and deployment," set the source to Deploy from a branch and select your main branch (usually main or master) and the /root folder.

Click Save.
